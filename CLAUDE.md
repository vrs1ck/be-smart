# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Development Commands

**Build and Run:**
- `go build ./cmd/main.go` - Build the application (after making changes, always run this to verify compilation)
- `make build` - Build with proper binary name (creates `todo-api`)
- `make run` - Run the application directly
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts

**Database Operations:**
- `make db-start` - Start Supabase local PostgreSQL environment
- `make db-up` - Run database migrations
- `make db-stop` - Stop Supabase environment
- `make db-reset` - Complete database reset (stop, start, migrate)

## Architecture Overview

This is a **dual-purpose REST API** serving both **todos and flashcards** with identical architectural patterns.

**Clean Architecture Pattern:**
- `cmd/main.go` - Application entry point with dependency injection
- `models/` - Data structures and DTOs (todo.go, flashcard.go)
- `handlers/` - HTTP request/response handling (todoHandler.go, flashcardHandler.go) 
- `services/` - Business logic and validation (todoService.go, flashcardService.go)
- `db/` - Repository pattern with PostgreSQL implementation (todoDb.go, flashcardDb.go)
- `config/` - Environment-based configuration management

**Key Patterns:**
- Both todos and flashcards follow **identical architectural patterns**
- Repository interfaces for database abstraction
- Service layer handles validation and business logic
- Handlers manage HTTP concerns (JSON, status codes, error responses)
- Gorilla Mux for routing with pattern-based routes (`/todos/{id:[0-9]+}`, `/flashcards/{id:[0-9]+}`)

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL with schema `gocourse.todos` and `gocourse.flashcards`
- Migrations in `supabase/migrations/` with timestamp prefixes
- Local development via Supabase CLI (accessible at localhost:54322)

**Data Models:**
- **Todos**: ID, Title, Description, Completed, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- **Flashcards**: ID, Content, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt (minimal content-only design)

**When adding new entities**, follow the exact same layered pattern: model → migration → repository → service → handler → route registration in main.go.

## Environment Setup

Requires `.env` file with:
- `DB_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `PORT` - Application port (defaults to 8080)

Both Docker and Supabase CLI must be installed and running for database operations.

## Development Workflow Guidance

- After each task is complete, go build the project to verify your work and then fix any issues which come up.
